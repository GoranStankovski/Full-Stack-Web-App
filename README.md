This is a full stack web app made following my current and favourite course for Spring boot.
Frontend (Made with React) and Backend (Spring Boot) are built separately and finnaly conected and comunicating throug API,s.
It starts as a simple React App that gradually grows into complex  web site where you must login and then add, update and delete To-do's.
The data processed at start is hard coded and then transitioned to H2 built-in database and then again transitioned to MySql using Docker.
Great learning experience.
